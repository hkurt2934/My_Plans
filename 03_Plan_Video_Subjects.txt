For kids:
1) Ressam Robot
2) Dog

Renewable Energy Sources (From Gpt).

1) Converters:
> Comparing between boost converter and sepic converter.
> Comparing between Zeta Converter and sepic converter
> Comparing between Sepic converter and Cuk converter
> Comparing between buck-boost converter and flyback converter, also in isolating and non-isolating
> Comparing between flyback converter and push-pull converter
> Comparing the efficiency 

2) How RLC effects on a circuit

3) How zenner diode works.

4) P-I-D paramters effect on output. 

5) Motor types. Dc Motor, Induction Motor and Synchronous Motor. 

6) DC Analysis:
In the circuit analysis video series has 4 differenet video.
> Video contains the introduction and Ohms law.
> video has kirchoff laws
> video has thevenin, northon and super position theorem
> video has ac/dc analysis why the frequency is zero for dc voltage.

7) Resistance, inductance capacitance and reluctance 

8) What is the synchronous speed of induction motor.

9) Solving EEE bachelor course questions.

10) KiCad, design an amplifier.
