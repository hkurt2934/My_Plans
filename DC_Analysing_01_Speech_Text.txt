7) Ohm’s Law: Understanding the Foundation of Circuit Analysis
Ohm's Law is one of the most fundamental principles in electronics and electrical engineering.
It establishes a direct relationship between three critical electrical quantities: voltage (V), current (I), and resistance (R).

7-1) The Law
Ohm’s Law states that the current flowing through a conductor between two points is directly proportional to the voltage across the two points and inversely proportional to the resistance of the conductor. Mathematically, it is expressed as:
V=I⋅R
Where:
V: Voltage (measured in volts, V)
I: Current (measured in amperes, A)
R: Resistance (measured in ohms, Ω)
This formula can also be rearranged to solve for any of the three variables:
I=V/R,
R=V/I.

7-2) Key Concepts
Voltage (V):
Voltage, or electric potential difference, is the force that drives electric charges through a circuit. It is similar to the pressure in a water pipe that pushes water through.

Current (I):
Current is the flow of electric charge in a circuit. It is analogous to the flow of water in a pipe.

Resistance (R):
Resistance is the opposition to the flow of current, similar to how the size of a pipe resists water flow. Materials with high resistance, like rubber, restrict current, while those with low resistance, like copper, allow it to flow more freely.

7-3) Practical Applications
Designing Circuits: Engineers use Ohm’s Law to determine the right values of resistors to achieve desired current or voltage levels.
Troubleshooting: Measuring voltage, current, or resistance in a circuit helps identify faulty components.
Power Calculations: By combining Ohm's Law with the power formula (P=V⋅I), engineers can optimize circuit performance.

7-4) Limitations of Ohm’s Law
It applies only to linear, ohmic materials, where the relationship between voltage and current is consistent.
It does not hold for non-ohmic components like diodes or transistors, where the current-voltage relationship is nonlinear.
