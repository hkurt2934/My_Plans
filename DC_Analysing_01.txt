Slide 7) Ohm’s Law: Understanding the Foundation of Circuit Analysis

Let’s dive in and unravel the fascinating world of electronics circuit analysis!
Ohm's Law is one of the most fundamental principles in electronics and electrical engineering.
It establishes a direct relationship between three critical electrical quantities: voltage (V), current (I), and resistance (R). We can say for the Ohms Law that it is dancing the voltage, resistance and current.

7-1) The Law
Ohm’s Law states that the current flowing through a conductor between two points is directly proportional to the voltage across the two points and inversely proportional to the resistance of the conductor. Mathematically, it is expressed as:
V=I⋅R
Where:
V: Voltage (measured in volts, V)
I: Current (measured in amperes, A)
R: Resistance (measured in ohms, Ω)
This formula can also be rearranged to solve for any of the three variables:
I=V/R,
R=V/I.

7-2) Key Concepts
Voltage (V):
Voltage, or electric potential difference, is the force that drives electric charges through a circuit. It is similar to the pressure in a water pipe that pushes water through.

Current (I):
Current is the flow of electric charge in a circuit. It is analogous to the flow of water in a pipe.

Resistance (R):
Resistance is the opposition to the flow of current, similar to how the size of a pipe resists water flow. Materials with high resistance, like rubber, restrict current, while those with low resistance, like copper, allow it to flow more freely.

7-3) Practical Applications
Designing Circuits: Engineers use Ohm’s Law to determine the right values of resistors to achieve desired current or voltage levels.
Troubleshooting: Measuring voltage, current, or resistance in a circuit helps identify faulty components.
Power Calculations: By combining Ohm's Law with the power formula (P=V⋅I), engineers can optimize circuit performance.

7-4) Limitations of Ohm’s Law
It applies only to linear, ohmic materials, where the relationship between voltage and current is consistent.
It does not hold for non-ohmic components like diodes or transistors, where the current-voltage relationship is nonlinear.
