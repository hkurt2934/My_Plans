Slide 7) Ohm’s Law: Understanding the Foundation of Circuit Analysis

Let’s dive in and unravel the fascinating world of electronics circuit analysis!
Ohm's Law is one of the most fundamental principles in electronics and electrical engineering.
It establishes a direct relationship between three critical electrical quantities: voltage (V), current (I), and resistance (R). We can say for the Ohms Law that it is the voltage dancing the between resistance and current.

Slide 8) The Ohms Law

Ohm’s Law states that the current flowing through a conductor between two points is directly proportional to the voltage across the two points and inversely proportional to the resistance of the conductor. Mathematically, it is expressed as:
V=I⋅R
Where:
V: Voltage (measured in volts, V)
V repsents the voltage. Unit for voltage is volt. the symbol for voltage is V.
I: Current (measured in amperes, A)
I represents the current. Unit of current is ampere. The symbol for current is A.
R: Resistance (measured in ohms, Ω)
R represents the resistance. Unit of resistance is Ohm. The symbol for resistance  is omega.
This above formula can also be rearranged to solve for any of the three variables:
I=V/R,
R=V/I.

Slide 9) Key Concepts In Ohms Law

Voltage (V):
Voltage, or electric potential difference compare to base point, is the force that drives electric charges through a circuit or wire. It is similar to the pressure in a water pipe that pushes water through.

Current (I):
Current is the flow of electric charge in a circuit. It is analogous to the flow of water in a pipe.

Resistance (R):
Resistance is the opposition to the flow of current, similar to how the size of a pipe resists water flow. Materials with high resistance, like rubber, restrict current, while those with low resistance, like copper, allow it to flow more freely.

Slide 10) Practical Applications

Designing Circuits: Engineers use Ohm’s Law to determine the right values of resistors to achieve desired current or voltage levels.
Troubleshooting: Measuring voltage, current, or resistance in a circuit helps identify faulty components.
Power Calculations: By combining Ohm's Law with the power formula (P=V⋅I), engineers can optimize circuit performance.

Slide 11) Limitations of Ohm’s Law

It applies only to linear, ohmic materials, where the relationship between voltage and current is consistent.
It does not hold for non-ohmic components like diodes or transistors, where the current-voltage relationship is nonlinear.

Slide 12) What is the Water Pipe Analogy

The water pipe analogy is a simple and intuitive way to explain how electrical circuits work by comparing them to a system of water flowing through pipes. Here's how the elements of a circuit correspond to the elements of a water system:
The water pipe analogy makes it easier to understand abstract electrical concepts by relating them to something tangible and familiar. It’s particularly helpful for explaining how voltage, current, and resistance interact in a circuit based on Ohm's Law.

Slide 13) Water Pipe Analogy for Ohm's Law

Voltage (V) - Water Pressure:
Voltage (V) is like the water pressure in a pipe.
Just as water pressure pushes water through a pipe, voltage pushes electrical current through a circuit. Higher pressure means more water flow, just as higher voltage means more current flow.
Current (I) - Water Flow:
Current (I) is like the flow of water through the pipe.
The amount of water flowing through the pipe is analogous to the electric current flowing through the circuit. More pressure results in more water flow, just as more voltage results in more current.
Resistance (R) - Pipe Narrowness or Obstruction
Resistance (R) is like the narrowness or obstruction in the pipe.
If the pipe is narrow or has an obstacle, it’s harder for water to flow. Similarly, resistance in a circuit restricts the flow of current. Higher resistance reduces current flow.
Battery/Power Supply - Water Pump
A battery or power supply is like a water pump that provides the pressure to move water through the system. In electrical terms, it provides the voltage that drives current through the circuit.
Capacitor - Water Tank
A capacitor is like a tank that stores water temporarily. It can release the water (current) when needed, similar to how a capacitor stores electrical charge and releases it.
Switch - Valve
A switch is like a valve in the water system. Opening the valve allows water to flow, just as closing a switch allows current to flow.

Slide 14) Example Using the Water Pipe Analogy

Imagine a water tank connected to a pipe:
If the pipe is wide (low resistance), a lot of water flows through when you increase the pressure (voltage).
If the pipe is narrow (high resistance), less water flows, even if you increase the pressure.
Similarly, in an electrical circuit:
For a fixed resistance, increasing the voltage will increase the current.
If the resistance increases, the current decreases for the same voltage.
